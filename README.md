# Hello

## Welcome to Cuee Site


Hello, and welcome to Cuee Site. In this website, I will present my hobby, complaining! This is similar to a blog of some sort. I will speak about my journey where I attempt to make a website for my class. I hope no one finds this. 

## My Journey or Something

Trying to figure out how to change the size of the image was quite difficult. It was done earlier, but after downloading the theme, the image disappeared. I think that if I either delete the theme or change it, it will come back. However, I quite like this theme so I don't really want to.

This is the image that is supposed to show up. Unfortunately, I don't know how to make it smaller.

I have given up on making it smaller, the theme makes the image look good enough. It doesn't need to be made smaller. However, I do need to add another image. I think I already ruined the aesthetic of this theme with the previous image. Having a website like this feels rather rewarding, though. Not that I did much. I think I should show a screenshot of the code.

This is how my code looks. Another thing I need to do for my project is input a link to another webpage. I'm not sure what my teacher means by this, so I will insert a link to my favrite video and hope that it is what my teacher is asking for. Actually, I lied. I might get copyright claimed. Here is the Wikipedia page for Blahaj.

## Conclusion

Well, that was basically my journey through making a website. I believe that I did what I was asked to do. Github was rather hard to use, but that might just be me. I would like to make another website someday, but since this is a school project, I'm worried about getting too ambitious and doing something wrong. We also only got around a week to do this so I can't afford to try to hard and mess everything up.
